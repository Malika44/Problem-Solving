This is a simple Python project that solves a problem everyday.

1- D1:🧠 Candle Problem:

You are given a list of integers where each number represents the height of a candle on a birthday cake. Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.

2-D3:🧩 Problem of the Day: Triangle of Balls
📝 Description
You are given two integers:

white: the number of white balls

black: the number of black balls

Your task is to build the tallest triangle possible, where:

Each row of the triangle must be made using only one color (either all white or all black).

The number of balls in each row increases by 1:

Row 1 needs 1 ball

Row 2 needs 2 balls

Row 3 needs 3 balls

3- D5: Triangle of Powers of 2:

This small Python program prints a symmetric triangle pattern using powers of 2, aligned to look like a real triangle.

📌 How It Works
You enter the height of the triangle (for example, 4).

The program prints rows where each row starts from 2^0 and goes up to a certain power, then mirrors back down without repeating the middle number.

The pattern is neatly centered, giving the appearance of a triangle.
