This is a simple Python project that solves a problem everyday.

1- D1:🧠 Candle Problem:

You are given a list of integers where each number represents the height of a candle on a birthday cake. Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.

2-D3:🧩 Problem of the Day: Triangle of Balls
📝 Description
You are given two integers:

white: the number of white balls

black: the number of black balls

Your task is to build the tallest triangle possible, where:

Each row of the triangle must be made using only one color (either all white or all black).

The number of balls in each row increases by 1:

Row 1 needs 1 ball

Row 2 needs 2 balls

Row 3 needs 3 balls

3- D5: Triangle of Powers of 2:

This small Python program prints a symmetric triangle pattern using powers of 2, aligned to look like a real triangle.

📌 How It Works
You enter the height of the triangle (for example, 4).

4-D6:Path Crossing Detection:

This Python program checks whether a moving point crosses its own path based on a given list of movement distances.

The point starts at coordinate (0, 0) and initially moves North.

The directions cycle in the order: North → West → South → East (and repeat).

For each distance in the list:

The point moves step-by-step.

Every position visited is recorded.

If the point visits any location more than once, the program returns True (indicating a crossing).

If the point never crosses its path, it returns False.

This ensures an accurate and detailed check of the entire path rather than just major stops.

The program prints rows where each row starts from 2^0 and goes up to a certain power, then mirrors back down without repeating the middle number.

The pattern is neatly centered, giving the appearance of a triangle.
