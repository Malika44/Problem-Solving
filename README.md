This is a simple Python project that solves a problem everyday.

1- D1:🧠 Candle Problem:

You are given a list of integers where each number represents the height of a candle on a birthday cake. Your task is to count how many candles are the tallest.

2-D3:🧩 Problem of the Day: Triangle of Balls
📝 Description
You are given two integers:

white: the number of white balls

black: the number of black balls

Your task is to build the tallest triangle possible, where:

Each row of the triangle must be made using only one color (either all white or all black).

The number of balls in each row increases by 1:

Row 1 needs 1 ball

Row 2 needs 2 balls

Row 3 needs 3 balls

and so on...

You can use either color for each row, but you must have enough balls of that color to complete the whole row.

Return the maximum height of the triangle.
